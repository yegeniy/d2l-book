        "*Events* are subsets of the sample space.\n",
        "For instance, the event \"the first coin toss comes up heads\"\n",

        "in the given sample space $\\mathcal{S}$,\n",
        "has the following properties:\n",

        "* The probability of any event $\\mathcal{A}$ is a nonnegative real number, i.e., $P(\\mathcal{A}) \\geq 0$;\n",
        "* The probability of the entire sample space is $1$, i.e., $P(\\mathcal{S}) = 1$;\n",

        "\n",
        "These axioms of probability theory,\n",
        "proposed by :citet:`Kolmogorov.1933`,\n",
        "can be applied to rapidly derive a number of important consequences.\n",

        "that the probability of any event $\\mathcal{A}$\n",
        "*or* its complement $\\mathcal{A}'$ occurring is 1\n",
        "(because $\\mathcal{A} \\cup \\mathcal{A}' = \\mathcal{S}$).\n",
        "We can also prove that $P(\\emptyset) = 0$\n",

        "is $P(\\mathcal{A} \\cap \\mathcal{A}') = 0$.\n",

        "## Random Variables\n",
        "\n",
        "When we spoke about events like the roll of a die\n",
        "coming up odds or the first coin toss coming up heads,\n",
        "we were invoking the idea of a *random variable*.\n",
        "Formally, random variables are mappings\n",
        "from an underlying sample space\n",
        "to a set of (possibly many) values.\n",
        "You might wonder how a random variable\n",
        "is different from the sample space,\n",
        "since both are collections of outcomes.\n",
        "Importantly, random variables can be much coarser\n",
        "than the raw sample space.\n",
        "We can define a binary random variable like \"greater than 0.5\"\n",
        "even when the underlying sample space is infinite,\n",
        "e.g., points on the line segment between $0$ and $1$.\n",
        "Additionally, multiple random variables\n",
        "can share the same underlying sample space.\n",
        "For example \"whether my home alarm goes off\"\n",
        "and \"whether my house was burgled\"\n",
        "are both binary random variables\n",
        "that share an underlying sample space.\n",
        "Consequently, knowing the value taken by one random variable\n",
        "can tell us something about the likely value of another random variable.\n",
        "Knowing that the alarm went off,\n",
        "we might suspect that the house was likely burgled.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Every value taken by a random variable corresponds\n",
        "to a subset of the underlying sample space.\n",
        "Thus the occurrence where the random variable $X$\n",
        "takes value $v$, denoted by $X=v$, is an *event*\n",
        "and $P(X=v)$ denotes its probability.\n",
        "Sometimes this notation can get clunky,\n",
        "and we can abuse notation when the context is clear.\n",
        "For example, we might use $P(X)$ to refer broadly\n",
        "to the *distribution* of $X$, i.e.,\n",
        "the function that tells us the probability\n",
        "that $X$ takes any given value.\n",
        "Other times we write expressions\n",
        "like $P(X,Y) = P(X) P(Y)$,\n",
        "as a shorthand to express a statement\n",

        "### 8. Assume that you are an asset manager for an investment bank and you have a choice of stocks $s_i$ to invest in. Your portfolio needs to add up to $1$ with weights $\\alpha_i$ for each stock. The stocks have an average return $\\boldsymbol{\\mu} = E_{\\mathbf{s} \\sim P}[\\mathbf{s}]$ and covariance $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma} = \\textrm{Cov}_{\\mathbf{s} \\sim P}[\\mathbf{s}]$.\n",
        "  1. Compute the expected return for a given portfolio $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}$.\n",
        "  1. If you wanted to maximize the return of the portfolio, how should you choose your investment?\n",
        "  1. Compute the *variance* of the portfolio.\n",
        "  1. Formulate an optimization problem of maximizing the return while keeping the variance constrained to an upper bound. This is the Nobel-Prize winning [Markovitz portfolio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markowitz_model) :cite:`Mangram.2013`. To solve it you will need a quadratic programming solver, something way beyond the scope of this book.\n"
